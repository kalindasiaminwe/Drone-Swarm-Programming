This repository contains code used to program a swarm of Tello drones. The drones operate automatically using defined commands which you have to include in the python code. 
 
# Contents
In this repository, you will find:  
1. .py file: contains the python code.
2. .txt files: contain commands that control the drones movements. Each drone has its own command file. The command files gets imported into the python code for auto flight of the drones.

# Getting started
